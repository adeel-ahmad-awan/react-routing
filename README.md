# React Routing

<!-- In this application, I have made a cart logic for adding and removing items from the cart. 
I have usedthe following concepts.

- using redux and redux-toolkit for state management 
- use single data store for redux
- using multiple reducers for state management
- handling http states and feedback with redux
- using action creator "THUNK"
- handling async code in side-effects
